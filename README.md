# TickTacToe

A simple game of TickTacToe written in QT C++

Written in QT5 using QtCreator, later refactored as a CMake project.
This was done as a simple exercise.

# Archived

I thought about updating and refactoring this project but decided it was too much work.  
Instead, this project will serve as a point of reference (and shame) to my future self to see how much I sucked. :p
